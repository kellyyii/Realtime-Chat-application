🚀 About This Repository
This repository is primarily used for testing the git push functionality with GitHub and automating the build process to generate a dist (distribution) folder for deployment.

The generated dist folder can be hosted using Apache (2.4), making it suitable for testing and deploying the frontend of a MERN stack application.

🔧 Note: This version may contain slight code differences compared to the main testing branch, as it includes deployment-specific adjustments and configurations.
